# Bootcamp-Project #02: Business Site
This project was about creating a business site containing a hero image (image changing depending on screen sizes), a signup form and an accordion. Sidenote: this project contains my first line of JavaScript.

## The problem
I started by sketching the site on paper and decided to seperate it into three sections.
I decided to work on the sections one after one (incl. styling) before wrapping them into a div for aligning them with flexbox. The html was followed by working on JavaScript for the accordeon (section "services") and then the form. Since I knew I didn't have much time this week for coding I went for a simple structure, which could have been easily extended with some extras if I had time. If more time was left I would have worked more on the JS to dive deeper into that. The idea would have been to change color in the accordion when it was clicked.  

Learning content and lessons learned: 
- HTML & CSS
- introduction to JavaScript (accordion)
- different inputs for a form
