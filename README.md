# Bootcamp-Project #02: Business Site
This project was about creating a business site containing a hero image (image changing depending on screen sizes), a signup form and an accordion. Sidenote: this project contains my first line of JavaScript.

## Learning content and lessons learned: 
- HTML (Forms and Forminputs)
- images and responsive design (Hero Image)
- introduction to JavaScript (accordeon)
- modify the DOM with Javascript

I started out by sketching the site on paper and decided to seperate it into three sections.
I decided to work on the sections one after one (incl. styling) before wrapping them into a div for aligning them with flexbox. The html was followed by working on JavaScript for the accordeon (section "services") and then the form. Since I knew I didn't have much time this week for coding I went for a simple structure, which could have been easily extended with some extras if I had time. If more time was left I would have worked more on the JS to dive deeper into that. The idea would have been to change color in the accordion when it was clicked.
