# Business Site

This project was about building a business site containing an image header (with three different pictures changing depending on screen sizes), a signup form and an accordion. 
My business site is about a photograph-studio and is separated in three sections (about the sudio, what they offer (accordeon) and form for getting in contact).

## The problem
I started by sketching the site on paper to get an idea of the whole site and then decided to seperate it into three sections.
In VSC I then started with the html (which I later on during the process expanded by adding classes and divs for the styling / aligning). I decided to work on the sections one after one (incl. styling) before wrapping them into a div for aligning them with flexbox. The html was followed by working on javascript for the accordeon (section "services") and then the form. Since I knew I didn't have much time this week for codeing I went for a simple and clear structure, which could have been easily extended with some extras if I had time. If more time was left I would have worked more on the JS to dive deeper into that. The idea would have been to change the header color in the accordion when it was clicked.
